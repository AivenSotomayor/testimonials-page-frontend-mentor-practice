              Ellos no eran tan amigos, pero se ca√≠an bien
              Iban juntos en la lista del famoso cuarto C
              Y es por eso que en pareja todo ten√≠an que hacer.
              Son pololos, son pololos
              Les dec√≠an los dem√°s
              Son pololos, son pololos
              Y se tienen que besar. ‚Äù</p>

            <h4>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
              learning from their experiences was easy.</h4>
            <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

            <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
            <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
              could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
              100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
